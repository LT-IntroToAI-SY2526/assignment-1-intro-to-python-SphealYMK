# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?

I personally think it is kind of confusing, but i can tell it is much more versatile then the other languages i have used
2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.

It helped me with learning some basics of python, and realized that AI has improved so well, that you don't need good prompts, for it to give more answers. or it could be based off the version
3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?

Transfering Github to VS code. and also I still don't really understand how asserts work.
4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?

You can use it to help with anything, to help with your idea making, game functioning, tips for anything, and just anything you can think of.
